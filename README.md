# Python-Training

Welcome to the Python-Training repo! 🎯

This repository collects small, single-file Python programs and examples organized by date (each folder is a day of practice). The goal is to learn basic Python syntax, fundamental data structures, simple algorithms, and OOP concepts across short, focused exercises.

How to use this repo
--------------------
- Each day folder is named with a date (e.g., `24-11-2025`). For readability, this README renames each folder as "Day N - Folder Name".
- To run a script: open a terminal and run `python3 <scriptname>.py` from the respective day folder (many scripts read stdin so they will prompt for input).
- These scripts are mostly standalone practice files; some are purely demonstrative and include `print` statements to show behavior.
