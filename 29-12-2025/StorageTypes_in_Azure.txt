📬 1. Queue Storage
What it is:
A simple message queue that allows one part of an application to send messages to another.
Where it is used:
Great for decoupling systems — when you don’t want two systems to talk directly.
✅ Real‑Life Example
E-commerce order processing:

A customer places an order on a website.
The website drops a message in Queue Storage: “Order #1234 placed.”
A background processing service (like Azure Functions) reads the message and processes payment, stock check, invoices, etc.

This helps the website stay fast and not slow down during processing.

📊 2. Table Storage
What it is:
A NoSQL key-value store used for storing structured, non-relational data.
Where it is used:
When you need fast lookups without complex relational queries.
✅ Real‑Life Example
Storing IoT device states:

A company has thousands of sensors sending temperature or humidity data.
Each sensor entry looks like:

DeviceID
Timestamp
Status (On/Off)
Temperature



Table Storage is cheap, quick, and perfect for this type of simple structured data.

🗂️ 3. Blob Storage
Blob = “Binary Large Object” — used for storing unstructured files.
Azure provides three blob types:

📦 3.1 Block Blobs
Used for:
Large files you upload/download in chunks.
✔ Real‑Life Example
Storing videos, photos, backups
For example:

A media streaming app stores movie files in Block Blobs
A company stores daily backup files (ZIP, ISO, logs, PDFs)

Block Blobs give fast uploading by splitting the file into blocks.

🧾 3.2 Append Blobs
Used for:
Data that grows over time by adding new entries.
✔ Real‑Life Example
Application logging
Suppose you have:

Web servers
API gateways
Background services

Each one writes logs every few seconds.
Append Blobs allow writing at the end without modifying old data — perfect for logs.

💽 3.3 Page Blobs
Used for:
Random read/write operations with high speed.
✔ Real‑Life Example
Virtual Machine Disks
When you create an Azure VM, its operating system disk and data disks are stored as Page Blobs.
They allow:

Fast random reads
Fast random writes

Same for Azure SQL Database underlying storage.

📁 4. File Storage
What it is:
A fully managed shared drive you can mount via SMB 3.0 protocol.
✔ Real‑Life Example
Replacing on-prem file servers
Scenario:

Your office has a shared network drive: \\companyshare\documents
You want to migrate this to the cloud
Azure File Storage gives the same shared folder experience
Employees can map it as a drive in Windows, Mac, or Linux

It supports:

Shared folders
Departmental file shares
Home directories
